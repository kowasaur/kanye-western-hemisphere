## Controls

- start/stop button to toggle movement
- left click drag to change the camera angle
- right click drag to change the camera position

Also try clicking the globe.

## Extension

I also made a Chrome extension that is exactly the same as the website. This doesn't work on firefox for some reason.

2. Extract it to wherever you want to store the extension
3. Go to the extensions page in chrome (chrome://extensions)
4. Enable developer mode (top right hand corner)
5. Click `Load unpacked` and select the extension folder
